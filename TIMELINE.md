# Timeline

## 2026-06-16

### Focus
Category taxonomy alignment, TanStack Query migration for publish forms

### What Changed
- **CategoryMultiselect** rewritten to load options from `specialties.json` — articles and podcasts now use the same practice area taxonomy as lawyer specialties
- **PublishPodcastForm** rewritten: `useMutation` replaces `useTransition`/`startTransition`; controlled state instead of raw FormData; matches `LawyerForm` pattern
- **PublishArticleForm** rewritten: same migration to `useMutation` + controlled state; old single-select category dropdown replaced with `CategoryMultiselect`
- **Migration default** changed from `'documentation'` to `'general-practice'` in `20260616000004_multiselect_categories.sql`

### Rationale
- Practice areas are what users search by; internal content categories were meaningless to readers
- TanStack Query provides consistent error/success/pending state across all directory forms

## 2026-06-16 (Second Session)

### Focus
Client inquiry system, listing detail page rewrite, inquiry inbox

### What Changed
- **Migration**: Created `lawyer_inquiries` table with RLS (anyone inserts, lawyers see their own, admins see all)
- **Server actions**: `submitInquiry`, `getInquiries`, `getInquiryStats`, `markInquiryRead`, `getAllInquiriesAdmin` — full CRUD for client-to-lawyer messaging
- **Listing detail page**: Complete rewrite of `/directory/lawyer/[id]/page.tsx` — Tailwind replaces CSS modules; shows all extended fields (education, awards, FAQs, working hours, social links, gallery, intro video, contact info, volunteer/pro bono); live contact form that submits to `lawyer_inquiries`; sticky sidebar with inquiry form and quick info card
- **Inquiry inbox**: New `app/directory/dashboard/inquiries/` page with split layout (list + detail panes), auto-marks as read when selected; linked from dashboard sidebar and stats card
- **Dashboard**: Inquiries stat card now shows live count + unread badge; Quick Actions now includes Inquiries card with badge

### Rationale
- Lawyers need to receive and manage client inquiries from their directory listing
- The listing detail page needed the full set of extended fields to match the live site's feature set
- Inbox follows the established dashboard layout pattern with sidebar navigation
